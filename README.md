### Project description

Game center is built to accomodate live betting on game tournaments hosted on the platform.Our smart contract implements back and lay betting concepts.

In live  betting, these types of bets are particularly useful because they will allow bettors to react and adjust their  bets based on the ongoing events in the game. The odds for back and lay bets can change in real-time as the game progresses, reflecting the current state of the match and the perceived likelihood of different outcomes.
Payouts are handed out based on outcome and odds to bettors .
